,"The yellow boxes above are the most ""typical"" values, and hence should be first carried out before others (in case we run out of CPU time). This assumes that each individual QuaLiKiz run will have Ati, Ate, Ane, s, q scanned (for dimnx of order 100,000). Of course you can change dimxn. Then the typical s is 1, and typical q is 2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
